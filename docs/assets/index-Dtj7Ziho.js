You step into a secluded glade, a place that feels untouched by time. The air is crisp, filled with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. A circle of towering trees, their leaves a brilliant tapestry of gold, crimson, and amber, stands as silent sentinels, walling this place off from the outside world. It's clear why this glade has remained hidden for so long.

Before you stands the true prize of your journey: the entrance to The Labyrinth of Lyre, Adorellan's most ancient and storied site. The entrance is formidable. Tall, ancient stone walls, grey and weathered with age, rise up to meet the sky. Set within these walls are thick, heavy wrought-iron gates, their surface pitted with rust and age. A dense curtain of thick, dark green vines chokes the gates, weaving through the bars so completely that nothing of the labyrinth beyond can be seen. The silence here is profound, broken only by the rustle of leaves under your feet.`},courtyard:{name:"The Garden of Grie",description:`With a final, desperate shove, the ancient iron gates groan in protest, their rusted hinges screaming as they reluctantly give way. You stumble forward, catching your balance on the cracked flagstones of a vast, open courtyard. The air here is still and heavy, carrying the scent of dust and forgotten time. With a brief look you notice the discarded remains of old camps and items that belonged to brave adventures long since forgotten.

In the centre of the courtyard, a once-grand fountain lies in ruins. Its stone basin shattered, and the statue that once stood proudly at its heart is now a toppled, moss-covered casualty of age. A trickle of dark, stagnant water weeps from a crack, pooling on the ground below.

Your eyes are drawn to the far side of the courtyard. Dominating the wall is a massive, intricate circular carving, its ancient design a complex web of interlocking lines and symbols that seem to writhe just at the edge of your vision. Flanking this mysterious emblem are two arched exits.

To the left, a sturdy iron gate, similar to the one you just forced open, blocks the archway, promising another challenge. To the right, the archway is filled with the splintered remains of a wooden door, hanging precariously from a single hinge, offering a seemingly easier, though perhaps more treacherous, path forward.`},bunkers:{name:"Bunker's Bend",description:"Rows of dusty, empty bunks line the walls of this large, cold room.

A small wooden table with two chairs sits in the center of the room; a leather vest is slung carelessly over the back of one.
