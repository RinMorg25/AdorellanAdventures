# AdorellanAdventures
My first coded, web browser, text-based adventure game. This is a WIP, and a constant Scope Creep.

Game Synopsis: Adorellan Adventures (so far)
Premise: The player is an adventurer who discovers a tattered journal detailing the legendary and dangerous "Labyrinth of Lyre," an ancient site rumored to hold unimaginable treasures. Inspired by the challenge that has defeated all who came before, the player decides to venture forth into the labyrinth to claim its riches and uncover its long-buried secrets.

Gameplay & Genre: "Adorellan Adventures" is a classic text-based role-playing game (RPG). The player begins by selecting a character archetype (such as Warrior, Rogue, or Mage) which determines their starting statistics. Gameplay progresses through typed commands (e.g., go forward, inspect statue, attack goblin) to explore, interact with the environment, and engage in combat.

The World: The game is set within the Labyrinth of Lyre, a complex and sprawling dungeon. The player enters through a secluded glade and navigates through a variety of interconnected locations, including:

A ruined courtyard with multiple paths.
An old armoury and abandoned bunkers.
A "Sunken Market" that acts as a central hub.
A "Forgotten Temple" and a "Scriptorium" filled with decaying books.
A safe zone called "Haven Shield," offering a brief respite.
The world is persistent, with items that are dropped remaining in the room and monsters staying dead once defeated.

Core Objectives & Puzzles: The primary goal appears to be reaching and unlocking "The Vault." This central puzzle requires the player to explore the labyrinth thoroughly to find two specific items:

A Red Key, found within the Scriptorium.
A Blue Key, which must be purchased for 25 gold from a friendly imp shopkeeper named Grebgela in "Greb's Grotto".
Along the way, the player must solve smaller puzzles, such as:

Finding lockpicks to open standard locked doors.
Winning a game of rock-paper-scissors against an enchanted door to gain access to the market area.
Key Features:

Character Progression: The player gains experience points by defeating monsters, allowing them to level up, which increases their health, attack, and defense stats.
Turn-Based Combat: When encountering hostile creatures like Goblins, a turn-based battle system is initiated. The player can choose to attack, use items (like healing potions), or attempt to flee.
NPC Interaction: The labyrinth is not entirely empty. The player can talk to and trade with at least one NPC, Grebgela the imp, who is crucial to completing the main quest.
Exploration & Discovery: The game encourages exploration, rewarding players with useful items, hidden passages, and the lore of the labyrinth.
Overall, "Adorellan Adventures" is a challenging text-based RPG that blends exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat into a compelling adventure to conquer a legendary dungeon.
